# Positivity

Welcome to the Positivity wiki!

If you have a question an issue or anything else that can't be applied to [issues](https://github.com/Elikill58/Positivity/issues), you can come on [discord](https://discord.gg/KHRVTX2).

## What is it ?

It's a web interface which is used to manage Negativity's informations.

It have been made for [Negativity v2](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/86874/) (premium). No support will be made if you are using this with free version.

## Where can I test it ?

You can go [here](https://negativity.fr/positivity) and use `root` / `root` password. Then, you will be able to see everything as admin.

Maybe a day we will propose:
- A host for all v2-buyers to make us able to manage their informations.
- Plugin for website such as Azurium.

Tell us if you would like one of them.
